# Behavior Cloning with World Models
In this project, we combine behavior cloning and world models, two techniques that are frequently used for their in-environment sample efficiency. Building on [IRIS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00588), a recent transformer-based world model system, we evaluate our approach using 3 Atari environments of differing difficulty levels from the [Atari100k benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00374). We explore different methods of using behavior cloning and our findings show that IRIS agents trained with behavior cloning outperform the baseline model in all of our environments.
